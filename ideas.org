Nika's ideas:

- [ ] colorful win/lose letters

- [ ] fireworks when winning

- [ ] different kinds of monsters: moving, hiding, shooting, poo, flies

- [ ] room doors

- [ ] coins

- [ ] timer for a level

My ideas:

- [X] fix texture mapping

- [X] png textures

- [ ] loading a map from cli args

- [ ] monsters overlapping: ray depth buffering used to find out whether sprite column
  should be painted

- [ ] double buffering for cleaner animated feeling

- [ ] monsters bouding box (on the visible part should be hittable)
