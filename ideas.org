Nika's ideas:

- [X] better projectile

- [X] windows

- [X] room doors

- [X] coins

- [-] different kinds of monsters: moving, hiding, shooting, poo, flies

  - [X] poo

  - [X] flies

  - [ ] unfinished apples

  - [ ] untidy bed

  - [ ] dangerous cat paws

  - [ ] flowers to water

- [ ] colorful win/lose letters

- [ ] fireworks when winning

- [ ] timer for a level

My ideas:

- [X] fix texture mapping

- [X] png textures

- [X] monsters overlapping: ray depth buffering used to find out whether sprite column
  should be painted

- [X] monsters bouding box (on the visible part should be hittable)

- [X] sprites should be draw from furthers to closest

- [X] nicer map specification

  - [X] numbers for wall textures

  - [X] letters for monsters and other sprites

- [X] a better way to load textures/sprites (a table?)

- [X] simple wall shading wolf3d-style by coloring horizontal/vertical walls differently

- [ ] double buffering for cleaner animated feeling

- [ ] loading a map from cli args

- [ ] main menu


Bugs:

- [X] perspective (sprite sorting?)

- [X] sometimes going through doors

- [ ] enemy touching (too many coins deducted)
