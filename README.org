* A little Ray Casting engine

Having played with ChatGPT a bit I wanted to see if it came make code of considerable
complexity. This is what we came up with together: a ray casting engine Wolfenstein3d
style.

Game design as suggested by my daugther, code by myself and ChatGPT. I'd say that 70% of
the code came from the AI, the rest is just me tweaking and making sure things work
together. The secret is to talk about limited subsets of code at a time and keeping enough
info in the context.

* The Game

Mission: cleanup the room by collecting coins andthrowing brushes at flies and poo. Use
arrows for movement, space for throwing the brush.

* Compilation

Written under and for Linux. So the usual stuff: make sure libSDL family of libraries is
there, as well as GCC:

#+begin_src shell
   make
   ./vlk3d # and don't you ask for cartoon before cleaning your room!
#+end_src
